              Pretty Little Liars is my favorite show. It's about four girls who gte their lives turned around by an evil figure. Aria was dating a guy who turned out ot be her English teacher. Hanna became the new "it" girl after losing weight. Spencer is the msart one but loves to take her older sister's boyfirends away from her. Emily is on the swim team and also likes the new girl on the block. They have to find this villan before she exposes them all. After finding out who is the villan they have to decide whether to let her out of jail or not. Before the court could decide the villan is murdered. I love this show because of all the suspense and all the drama that comes with it.

They have to deal with massive accidents and what life has to throw at them. This show has a lot of drama and funny charcters. Some of the characters are Meredith Grey, Derek Shephard, Mark Sloan, Alex Karev, Miranda Bailey, Cristina Yang and many more. Meredith Grey has to face some hardships like her husband, Derek Shepards death. She is not okay and she needs her friend Cristina but she is on the other side of the world.  </p>
