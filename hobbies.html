             I like reading because I feel like I'm part of the book. It relaxes me and it helps me escape from the harsh reality. The type of books I like to read are drama and mystery.

         <p>I love listening to music. It puts me in a good mood. I listen to it when I'm doing my homework because it helps me. Whenever I feel down I just start listening to music. It relives my stress and I meet new people who have the same taste in music.</p>
