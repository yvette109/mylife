            <p>
              Fast and the Furious 7 is my favorite movie. It has a lot of action in it and it is on the edge thrilling. I love action movies. The cool parts are all the stunts especially the car jumping out of the airplane. I thought the movie was a great tribute to Paul Walker.

            <h3>Deadpool</h3>
            <img src="img/deadpool.jpg">
            <p>Deadpool is a very funny movie and it has cool action stunts. If you love funny movies than this movie is for you. He is a fun character and the action scenes are awesome. It makes it in slow motion so it looks a lot cooler. </p>

            <h4>Pitch Perfect</h4>
            <img src="img/pitchperfect.jpg" width="300px">
         <p>Pitch Perfect had me laughing till my sides hurt. I love comedy movies especially if Rebel Wilson is in it. All the characters were funny and the actors fit their roles perfectly.</p>

         <h5>The Fault In Our Stars</h5>
         <img src="img/stars.jpg" width="250px">
         <p>The Fault In Our Stars is a very moving story about a teenager named Hazel Grace Lancaster who was diagnosed with cancer and fell in love with Gus Waters who also had cancer. This movie makes you feel what love really is. I almost cried during this movie. It is a really good movie to see if you haven't.</p>
